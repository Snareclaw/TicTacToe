Starting with player A, each player takes turns choosing where to place their marker (either X for player A or O for player B). Each marker is placed by left clicking once on the cell that the player wants to place their piece on. The current player is displayed at the top of the page.

When a game ends, the game will display one of three outcomes, depending on which was reached:
- Winner: Player A
- Winner: Player B
- Draw
