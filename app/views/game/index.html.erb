      <p>The current player must left click on one of the squares in order to mark it as theirs. Once a square is marked, the next player takes their turn in a similar fashion. Gameplay ends when either one player marks three squares in a row, resulting in a win for that player, or if all squares are marked without three in a row, in which case the game is declared a draw. Play always begins with Player X.</p>
